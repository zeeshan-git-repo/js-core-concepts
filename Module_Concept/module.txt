Module System in JS is a technique to access code(function, class,variables)
of one file into another file.

We can implement module system using two patterns-
1. Common JS module pattern (node js, express js support this)
2. ES6 module pattern (React,Angular, vue.js, node js, express js support his)

ES6 module pattern=> 
It is a design pattern to implement module system in JS.
To work with this pattern following configuration need to be done.
    create a file called package.json
    add a object in the package.json file
    inside the object add following property 
    "type":"module"
    if it not written browser will understand this is common js pattern.

There are two ways to export Javascript code
1. Named export
2. Default export
