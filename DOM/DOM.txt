To modifying html element dynamically, javascript uses DOM. JS doesn't understand
tags<> so all these tags are converted into object because of DOM, hence JS easily manipulate
using objects.
JS can access para<> and it can change content of that tag and add/remove also. But directly it can not access para<> tags.
Browser will repaint(updates) your UI by JS changes.
By modifying DOM we can create dynamic UI. It is called DOM Manipulating.

May be internally structure is like below - 
window = {
    document:{
        html:{
            head:{

            },
            body:{

            }
        }
    }
}

The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is the browser’s in-memory, tree-like representation of an HTML/XML document, enabling structured, programmatic access and manipulation of elements, attributes, and styles. For interviews, you should emphasize its architecture, lifecycle, performance considerations, and modern best practices.

🌐 Core Concepts of the DOM
- Definition: The DOM is not HTML itself, but a live object-oriented API that represents the document structure.
- Tree Structure: Every node (element, attribute, text) is part of a hierarchical tree with document as the root.
- Node Types:
- Element nodes: <div>, <p>, etc.
- Text nodes: actual text inside elements.
- Attribute nodes: element attributes like class, id.
- Live Representation: Unlike static HTML, the DOM updates dynamically as the page changes.
