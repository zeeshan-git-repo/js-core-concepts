Script Placement: Head vs Body


1. Script in <head>
- Default behavior:
- When a <script> tag is placed in the <head> without async or defer, the browser parses HTML until it hits the script, then blocks rendering while downloading and executing it.
- This can delay page rendering and cause a “flash of blank page” if scripts are large.
- Best practice:
- Use defer or async attributes to avoid blocking:
- defer: Executes script after HTML parsing is complete, in order.
- async: Executes script as soon as it’s downloaded, order not guaranteed.

Example -
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Script Loading Example</title>

  <!-- Script with defer: downloaded in parallel, executed after HTML parsing, in order -->
  <script src="deferred-script.js" defer></script>

  <!-- Script with async: downloaded in parallel, executed immediately when ready, order not guaranteed -->
  <script src="async-script.js" async></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This content loads before scripts execute.</p>
</body>
</html>

- defer
- Scripts are fetched in parallel with HTML parsing.
- Execution happens after the document is fully parsed.
- Multiple deferred scripts preserve execution order.
- Best practice for most cases.

- async
- Scripts are fetched in parallel with HTML parsing.
- Execution happens as soon as the script is ready, potentially before parsing finishes.
- Multiple async scripts may execute out of order.
- Best for independent scripts (e.g., analytics, ads).



2. Script in <body> (usually at the end)
- Default behavior:
- By the time the script runs, most of the DOM is already parsed.
- No blocking of initial rendering → faster perceived load.
- Best practice:
- Common in legacy apps before defer existed.
- Today, defer in <head> is preferred because it keeps scripts organized and predictable.
👉 Interview takeaway:
Scripts in <head> block rendering unless defer/async is used. Scripts at the end of <body> avoid blocking but are less clean. Modern practice: put scripts in <head> with defer.
