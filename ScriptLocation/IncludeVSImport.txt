Include Script (classic <script src="...">)
- Loads a JavaScript file globally into the page.
- All variables/functions are added to the global scope (unless wrapped).
- No dependency management, no encapsulation.
- Order matters: if script B depends on script A, A must be loaded first.
- Example:
<script src="utils.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>

2. Import Script (ES Modules)
- Introduced with ES6 (<script type="module">).
- Scripts are treated as modules:
- Scoped (no pollution of global namespace).
- Can import and export specific functions/objects.
- Automatically deferred (no blocking).
- Supports dependency graphs (browser resolves imports).
- Example:
<script type="module">
  import { add } from './math.js';
  console.log(add(2, 3));
</script>


- Benefits:
- Cleaner architecture.
- Encourages modular design.
- Industry standard in modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
